<p class="from-them">I'm excited to share that we're appointing @elonmusk to our board ! Through conversations
with Elon in recent weeks , it became clear to me that he would bring great value to our
Board . Why ? Above all else , he's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service
which is exactly what we need on Twitter , and in the Boardroom , to make us stronger in the
long - term . Welcome Elon !</p>

<p class="from-them">Would you be able to do a q & a for employees next week virtually ? My travel is causing too
long of a delay and only about 10-15 % of audience will be in person so we will be optimizing
for virtual anyways . Would any of Wed / Thu 11a pacific next week work for you for a 45 min
video q & a ? - else I can suggest other times . Trying to maximize attendance across global
timezones .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-04-07 10:53:34 ( CDT )</div>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-04-07 12:20:09 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">Yep - will set up a product + eng conversation ahead of q & a - they said , I expect most
questions to not get into specific ideas / depth - but more around what you believe about the
future of Twitter and why it matters , why you can personally , how to want to engage with us ,
what you hope to see change ... - but also some from people who are upset that you are
involved and generally don't like you for some reason . As you said yesterday , goal is for
people to just hear you speak directly instead of make assumptions about you from media
stories . Would Thursday 11a pacific work next week for the q & a ?</p>
