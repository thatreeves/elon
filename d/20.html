<p class="from-them">Yes , a new platform is needed . It can't be a company . This is why I left .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-26 20:13:46 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">What should it look like ?</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-26 20:52:31 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">I believe it must be an open source protocol , funded by a foundation of sorts that doesn't
own the protocol , only advances it . A bit like what Signal has done . It can't have an
advertising model . Otherwise you have surface area that governments and advertisers will try
to influence and control . If it has a centralized entity behind it , it will be attacked . This isn't
complicated work , it just has to be done right so it's resilient to what has happened to twitter .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-26 20:58:04 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">Super interesting idea</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-26 21:00:35 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">I'm off the twitter board mid May and then completely out of company . I intend to do this
work and fix our mistakes . Twitter started as a protocol . It should have never been a
company . That was the original sin .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-26 21:01:24 ( CDT )</div>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-26 21:03:23 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">I wanted to talk with you about it after I was all clear , because you care so much , get it's
importance , and could def help in immeasurable ways . Back when we had the activist come
in , I tried my hardest to get you on our board , and our board said no . That's about the time I
decided I needed to work to leave , as hard as it was for me .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-26 21:51:53 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">I think the main reason is the board is just super risk averse and saw adding you as more risk ,
which I thought was completely stupid and backwards , but I only had one vote , and 3 % of
company , and no dual class shares . Hard set up . We can discuss more .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-26 21:53:17 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">Let's definitely discuss more</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-26 21:54:23 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">I think it's worth both trying to move Twitter in a better direction and doing something new
that's decentralized</p>

<p class="from-them">I want to make sure Parag is doing everything possible to build towards your goals until close .
He is really great at getting things done when tasked with specific direction . Would it make
sense for me you and him to get on a call to discuss next steps and get really clear on what's
needed ? He'd be able to move fast and clear then . Everyone is aligned and this will help even
more .</p>

<p class="from-them">I put together a draft list to make the discussion efficient . Goal is to align around 1 ) problems
we're trying to solve , 2 ) long term priorities , 3 ) short - term actions , all using a higher level
guide you spoke about . Think about what you'd add / remove . Getting this nailed will increase
velocity ,</p>
