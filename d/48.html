<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-04-25 20:15:29 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">I think Sam has it yes . He actually said up to 10 at one point but in writing he said up to 5 .
He's into you . And he specifically said the blockchain piece is only if you liked it and not
gonna push it . Orlando referred Sams interest to us and will be texting you to speak to say
why he ( Orlando ) declined . We agree orlando needs to call you and explain given everything
he said to us and you . Will make that happen We can push Sam to next week but I do
believe you will like him . Ultra Genius and doer builder like your formula . Built FTX from
scratch after MIT physics . Second to Bloomberg in donations to Biden campaign .</p>

<p class="from-them">got it . Will forward the equity interest email to Jared and Alex that he sent in and have it in the
queue in the event his interest is needed overall . Absent the blockchain piece he's focused on
investing if you want his interest in Twitter and your mission but we can park him for now .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-04-25 20:04:43 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">Agree . Was one piece of equation and I do think he would be at least 3bn if you like him and want
him , maybe more . Will work with Jared and Alex to be sure it makes sense to meet - my instinct
is it does because Orlando Braco also declined today in the end ( not sure if political fears or what
but he flaked today ) .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-05-04 04:06:20 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">No response from Bret , not even an interest in talking . I think it's probably best to release the debt
tomorrow . This might take a while .</p>

<p class="from-them">Nikesh came to see me this afternoon . Just to talk Twitter and you . If you had the time he would
cancel his plans tomorrow night to meet with you and come to where you are in SF or mid
peninsula Or he could fly to Austin another time of course . If you want me to send him to you
after the Twitter meeting let me know and he will break his plans to do</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-05-05 21:13:06 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">It's fine , no need to break his plans .</p>

<p class="from-them">asked Pat and Kristina to each spend the weekend writing up their transition and diligence plan
and how to approach debt rating agencies on may 16. We need one of them signed up
( employment contract for 3 months ) as Transition CFO of X Holdings and owning the model and
diligence from financial point of view on the follow up meetings with Twitter on costs and users and
engineers etc. We believe two will not work at the agencies or in front of debt investors as you
have to have one CFO . If you were willing to have SVP Ops of X Holdings ( Pat would be more
qualified for that than Kristina ) then it's possible to retain them both for the transition . The way to
stay on ludicrous speed is to pick one of them tomorrow as transition CFO and then we run with it
full metal jacket . I believe each can do the job and deliver the ratings and debt and transition plan
for day one . Then you dismiss him / her as job well done or offer permanent CFO if you choose .
You get the speed and certainty we need now but not locked into anything for future .</p>

<p class="from-them">Understood . If the pace stays rapid each are good enough to get job done for the debt . Then you
hire great for go forward . But will pause for May 9 Vladimir and hope for the best there . We can
take stock of where things look after that</p>

<p class="from-me">An extremely fundamental due diligence item is understanding exactly how Twitter confirms that
95 % of their daily active users are both real people and not double - counted .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-05-08 18:24:56 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">They couldn't answer that on Friday , which is insane .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-05-08 18:27:33 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">If that number is more like 50 % or lower , which is what I would guess based on my feed , then they
have been fundamentally misrepresenting the value of Twitter to advertisers and investors .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-05-08 19:36:23 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">To be super clear , this deal moves forward if it passes due diligence , but obviously not if there are
massive gaping issues .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-05-08 19:37:04 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">True user account is a showstopper if actually much lower than the 95 % claimed</p>

<p class="from-me">Parag said that Twitter has 2500 coders doing at least 100 lines per month . Maybe they could fit
