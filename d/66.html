<p class="from-them">Hey - I saw your poll on twitter about Twitter and free speech . I'm not sure if this is what's
your mind , but my collaborator Sam Bankman - Fried ( https://www.forbes.com/profile/sam
bankman - fried / ? sh - 5b254fbf4449 ) has for a while been potentially interested in purchasing
it and then making it better for the world . If you want to talk with him about a possible joint
effort in that direction , his number is and he's on Signal .</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-29 21:24:32 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">Does he have huge amounts of money ?</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-30 17:33:40 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">Depends on how you define " huge " ! He's worth $ 24B , and his early employees ( with shared
values ) bump that to $ 30B . I asked about how much he could in principle contribute and he
said : " ~ $ 1-3b would be easy ~ $ 3-8b I could do ~ $ 8-15b is maybe possible but would require
financing "</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-30 17:34:40 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">If you were interested to discuss the idea I asked and he said he'd be down to meet you in
Austin</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-30 17:36:07 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">He's based in the Bahamas normally . And I might visit Austin next week , if you'd be around ?</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-31 01:20:28 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">That's a start</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-31 16:46:35 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">Would you like me to intro you two via text ?</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-31 21:25:58 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">Very much so ! Very dedicated to making the long - term future of humanity go well</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-31 21:26:26 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">Ok then sure</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-31 21:27:15 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">Great ! Will use Signal</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-03-31 21:32:40 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-them">( Signal doesn't work ; used imessage instead )</p>

<div class="text-xs text-grey-600 mt-2">2022-04-01 00:33:23 ( CDT )</div>
<p class="from-me">Ok</p>
