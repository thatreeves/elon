            <p class="from-them">Elon - are you able to access your Twitter account ok ? I saw a number of emails held in spam .
Including some password resets attempts</p><p class="from-me">I haven't tried recently</p><p class="from-me">Am staying off twitter</p><p class="from-me">Is my twitter account posting anything ?</p><p class="from-them">Not posting but I see one deactivation email and a dozen password reset emails . Assuming
this is a scammer attempt but wanted to check to ensure you still had access to your Twitter</p><p class="from-me">It is someone trying to hack my twitter</p><p class="from-me">But I have two - factor enabled with the confirmation app</p><p class="from-them">OK , great to hear .</p><p class="from-them">Yes - FaceTimed with them to confirm my identity ( hah ) and they are hopefully gonna reset
your ZFA to SMS soon . Asking for an update now</p><p class="from-me">Sounds good</p><p class="from-me">I can also FaceTime with them if still a problem</p><p class="from-them">Tldr ; your account is considered high profile internally over there . So they've made it very
hard to make changes like this by their teams . They are working through it ....</p><p class="from-me">Happy to FaceTime directly</p><p class="from-me">Not sure how I was able to make Twitter work on this new phone , as I didn't use the backup
code .</p><p class="from-them">Connecting with their head of Trust & Safety now</p><p class="from-them">I assume we used your old phone to verify the new , once upon a time</p><p class="from-me">Oh yeah</p><p class="from-them">They can fix it by disabling all 2FA for your account which will let you in and then you can re
enable it . Are you available in 90 mins to have them coordinate it ?</p><p class="from-me">Liked " They can fix it by disabling all 2FA for your account which will let you in and then you
can re - enable it . Are you available in 90 mins to have them coordinate it ? "</p><p class="from-them">I know things are in flux right now , but is EMDesk SpaceX still your primary calendar ? I realize
there a meeting on there in 1 hour . In case I should move this twitter fix out a bit .</p><p class="from-me">Yeah</p><p class="from-me">But I can step off the call briefly to FaceTime them if need be</p><p class="from-them">Sounds good . And ideally I'm just texting you to sign in once they disable 2FA and then you
can immediately sign in and re - enable . No FaceTime needed .</p><p class="from-me">Liked " Sounds good . And ideally I'm just texting you to sign in once they disable 2FA and then

Please try to log in now</p><p class="from-them">Able to get back in ok ?</p><p class="from-me">Liked " Able to get back in ok ?
