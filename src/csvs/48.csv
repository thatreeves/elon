( employment contract for 3 months ) as Transition CFO of X Holdings and owning the model and
diligence from financial point of view on the follow up meetings with Twitter on costs and users and
engineers etc. We believe two will not work at the agencies or in front of debt investors as you
have to have one CFO . If you were willing to have SVP Ops of X Holdings ( Pat would be more
qualified for that than Kristina ) then it's possible to retain them both for the transition . The way to
stay on ludicrous speed is to pick one of them tomorrow as transition CFO and then we run with it
full metal jacket . I believe each can do the job and deliver the ratings and debt and transition plan
for day one . Then you dismiss him / her as job well done or offer permanent CFO if you choose .
