He's into you . And he specifically said the blockchain piece is only if you liked it and not
gonna push it . Orlando referred Sams interest to us and will be texting you to speak to say
why he ( Orlando ) declined . We agree orlando needs to call you and explain given everything
he said to us and you . Will make that happen We can push Sam to next week but I do
believe you will like him . Ultra Genius and doer builder like your formula . Built FTX from

and how to approach debt rating agencies on may 16. We need one of them signed up
( employment contract for 3 months ) as Transition CFO of X Holdings and owning the model and
diligence from financial point of view on the follow up meetings with Twitter on costs and users and
engineers etc. We believe two will not work at the agencies or in front of debt investors as you
have to have one CFO . If you were willing to have SVP Ops of X Holdings ( Pat would be more
qualified for that than Kristina ) then it's possible to retain them both for the transition . The way to
stay on ludicrous speed is to pick one of them tomorrow as transition CFO and then we run with it
full metal jacket . I believe each can do the job and deliver the ratings and debt and transition plan
for day one . Then you dismiss him / her as job well done or offer permanent CFO if you choose .
You get the speed and certainty we need now but not locked into anything for future .,48,Michael,"Michael Grimes, Self",,"Michael Grimes, Self",,Michael Grimes Self (
