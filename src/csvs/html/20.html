own the protocol , only advances it . A bit like what Signal has done . It can't have an
advertising model . Otherwise you have surface area that governments and advertisers will try
to influence and control . If it has a centralized entity behind it , it will be attacked . This isn't
complicated work , it just has to be done right so it's resilient to what has happened to twitter .</p><p class="from-me">Super interesting idea</p><p class="from-them">I'm off the twitter board mid May and then completely out of company .

which I thought was completely stupid and backwards , but I only had one vote , and 3 % of
