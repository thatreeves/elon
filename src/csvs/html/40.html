            <p class="from-me">I have an idea for a blockchain social media system that does both payments and short text
messages / links like twitter . You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the
chain , which will cut out the vast majority of spam and bots . There is no throat to choke , so
free speech is guaranteed .</p><p class="from-me">The second piece of the puzzle is a massive real - time database that keeps a copy of all
blockchain messages in memory , as well as all message sent to or received by you , your
followers and those you follow .</p><p class="from-me">Third piece is a twitter - like app on your phone that accessed the database in the cloud .</p><p class="from-me">This could be massive</p><p class="from-them">I'd love to learn more .
