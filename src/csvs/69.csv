will be $ 78 and that cash receipts will also be $ 7B . However , the cash receipts number doesn't
seem realistic , given that they expect only $ 1.28 in Q2 , which is just $ 4.8B annualized .",69,Self,"Redacted, Self",,"Redacted, Self",,

proxy numbers vs current reality . we are developing proformas that have lower revenue / receipts

expense base , pre any actions we would take and provide a simplified strawman of possible
savings . he said they are not planning on doing an updated fcst for 22/23 . i think this is ok re
process since i think their fcst would not likely be very good and we wouldn't likely use it anyways .
They fly at way too high a level to have a fcst of much value . We are in process of developing
revenue fcst and a range of sensitivities and will then walk thru w them to get their input .",69,,"Redacted, Self",,"Redacted, Self",,
