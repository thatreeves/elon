608,| 2022-04-27 21:30:47 ( CDT ),| 2022-04-27 21:30:47 ,From a social perspective - Twitter allowing for high quality video uploads ( 1080p at a

Especially useful for citizen journalism & fun educational content . Might even help Twitter
regain market share lost to TikTok,64,Viv Hantusch,"Viv Hantusch, Self",,"Viv Hantusch, Self",,
