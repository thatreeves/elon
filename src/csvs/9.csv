intro to you : "" I believe I can be helpful to Twitter's team going forward - thinking about how
to handle speech and moderation , how that intersects with ideas about governance , how to
navigate actual govemment ( including future threats to Section 230 ) , etc. - and I'd love to
connect with Elon if he's interested in connecting ( I don't have a direct way to contact him ) . I
believe my experience and expertise can be useful , and my general outlook aligns with his
stated goals . Thanks . All the best . "" Please LMK if you want to connect with him .",David Sacks,"David Sacks, Self",No,David Sacks
