( Brookfield ) have "" decided against providing an equity cheque "" for a Twitter buyout . I just wanted
to let you know that didn't come from us- we would never comment ( on or off the record ) about
something like that , particularly when it relates to one of our partners . We appreciate all that we
are doing on solar together and you allowing us to participate in the Boring Co raise this week .
While I'm sure you don't believe anything you read in the FT anyway , I'm sorry if the article caused
any aggravation . If there is anything we can do to be helpful , please do let me know .",Brian Kingston,"Brian Kingston, Self",No,Brian Kingston
