2022-04-06 09:40:03 ,"#Status Quo : it is the de facto public town square , but it is a problem that it does not adhere
to free speech principles . = > so the core product is pretty good , but ( i ) it does not serve
democracy , and ( ii ) the current business model is a dead end as reflected by flat share price .
#Goal : Make Twitter the global backbone of free speech , an open market place of ideas that
truly complies with the spirit of the first amendment and shift the business model to a
combination of ad - supported and paid to support quality #Game Plan : 1 . ) ,, Solve Free
Speech " 1a ) Step 1 : Make it censorship - FREE by radically reducing Terms of Services ( now
hundreds of pages ) to the following : Twitter users agree to : ( 1 ) Use our service to send spam
or scam users , ( 2 ) Promote violence , ( 3 ) Post illegal pornography . 1b ) Step 2 : Make
Twitter censorship - RESISTANT • Ensure censorship resistance by implementing measures
that warrant that Twitter can't be censored long term , regardless of which government and
management . How ? Keep pushing projects at Twitter that have been working on
developing a decentralized social network protocol ( e.g. , BlueSky ) . It's not easy , but the
backend must run on decentralized infrastructure , APIs should become open ( back to the
roots ! Twitter started and became big with open APIs ) . Twitter would be one of many
clients to post and consume content . Then create a marketplace for algorithms , e.g. , if
you're a snowflake and don't want content that offends you pick another algorithm . 2. )
Solve Share Price " Current state of the business : Twitter's ad revenues grow steadily
and for the time being , are sufficient to fund operations . MAUs are flat , no structural
growth Share price is flat , no confidence in the existing business model and / or
