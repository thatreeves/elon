will be $ 78 and that cash receipts will also be $ 7B . However , the cash receipts number doesn't

minimum ) & adding a basic in - app video editor would have quite a big impact I think .
Especially useful for citizen journalism & fun educational content . Might even help Twitter
regain market share lost to TikTok"
